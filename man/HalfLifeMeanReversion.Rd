\usage{
HalfLifeMeanReversion(y, type, lags)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Vector to be tested for a unit root.}

\item{type}{Test type, either "none", "drift" or "trend".}

\item{lags}{Number of lags for endogenous variable to be included.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} of ADF test results
}
\description{
Computed from an Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process. This is the theoretically computed time, based on a historical window of data,
that it will take for the spread to mean-revert half of its distance after having diverged from the mean of the spread.
